# MCA 1st Semester - Data Structures with C++

## Overview

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental data structures for the MCA 1st semester. The goal is to help you understand and work with basic data structures.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by data structure type:

- **arrays/**: Implementations of array operations.
- **linked_lists/**: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **stacks/**: Stack operations using arrays and linked lists.
- **queues/**: Queue implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **trees/**: Binary trees and binary search trees.
- **graphs/**: Graph representations using adjacency lists and matrices.

## Getting Started

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sameerkhan9412/MCA-Lab1-Files.git
   ```


## Usage

Compile the `.cpp` files using `g++` and run the resulting executable to see how each data structure works.
